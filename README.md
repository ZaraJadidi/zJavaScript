## Calculation

<br>
Multiplication:
<br>
Multiplication is done using an asterisk symbol * :
<br>
console.log(1*2)
<br>
<br>
Division :
<br>
Division is done using a slash:
<br>
console.log(42/7);
<br>
<br>
Exponentiation:
<br>
Two asterisks ** are used to raise a number to the power of another, which is called exponentiation.
<br>
console.log(x**y);
<br>
<br>
Remainder:
<br>
It is used to calculate the remainder of a division.
<br>
console.log(x % y );
<br>
<br>
Increment:
<br>
Sometimes we need to repeatedly add 1 to a variable.For example, when counting attempts in a game, or the number of clicks on a web page.This can be done using the increment (++) operator:
<br>

```
let count = 0;
count++;
console.log(count);
```
<br>
<br>
Decrement:
<br>
the decrement (--) operator can be used to subtract 1 from a variable.
